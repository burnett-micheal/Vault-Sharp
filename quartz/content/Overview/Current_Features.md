## Current Features
### System
Docs: [[Codebase/Features/System|System Docs]]
Status: Done.

**Description**
The "System" feature is meant to hold commands / functionality that doesn't fit cleanly into other categories, or could be used across many categories. Some examples include basic back / forward navigation, opening the staged input folder in vscode, or opening the markdown main view in obsidian. The "System" feature is considered foundational, and should always be used.

### DBDashboard
Docs: [[Codebase/Features/DBDashboard|DBDashboard]]
Status: Functional, but in development.

**Description**
The "DBDashboard" feature is meant to be a debugging tool for your local SQLite DB. It adds basic CRUD, paginated table views, and detailed views for individual records / rows. Think of it as a sort of database dashboard / debugger.
